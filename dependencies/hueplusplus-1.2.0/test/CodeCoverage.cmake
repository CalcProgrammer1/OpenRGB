# CHANGES:
#
# 2012-01-31, Lars Bilke
# - Enable Code Coverage
#
# 2013-09-17, Joakim Söderberg
# - Added support for Clang.
# - Some additional usage instructions.
#
# 2016-02-03, Lars Bilke
# - Refactored functions to use named parameters
#
# 2017-06-02, Lars Bilke
# - Merged with modified version from github.com/ufz/ogs
#
#
# USAGE:
#
# 1. Copy this file into your cmake modules path.
#
# 2. Add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt:
#      include(CodeCoverage)
#
# 3. Append necessary compiler flags:
#      APPEND_COVERAGE_COMPILER_FLAGS()
#
# 4. If you need to exclude additional directories from the report, specify them
#    using the COVERAGE_EXCLUDES variable before calling SETUP_TARGET_FOR_COVERAGE.
#    Example:
#      set(COVERAGE_EXCLUDES 'dir1/*' 'dir2/*')
#
# 5. Use the functions described below to create a custom make target which
#    runs your test executable and produces a code coverage report.
#
# 6. Build a Debug build:
#      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
#      make
#      make my_coverage_target
#
