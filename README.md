One of the biggest complaints about RGB is the software ecosystem surrounding it.  Every manufacturer has their own app, their own brand, their own style.  If you want to mix and match devices, you end up with a ton of conflicting, functionally identical apps competing for your background resources.  On top of that, these apps are proprietary and Windows-only.  Some even require online accounts.  What if there was a way to control all of your RGB devices from a single app, on Windows, Linux, and MacOS, without any nonsense?  That is what OpenRGB sets out to achieve.  One app to rule them all.

## Features

* Set colors and select effect modes for a wide variety of RGB hardware
* Save and load profiles
* Control lighting from third party software using the OpenRGB SDK
* Command line interface
* Connect multiple instances of OpenRGB to synchronize lighting across multiple PCs
* Can operate standalone or in a client/headless server configuration
* View device information
* No official/manufacturer software required
* Graphical view of device LEDs makes creating custom patterns easy

## WARNING!

This project interacts directly with hardware using reverse engineered protocols.  While we do our best to make sure we're sending the right data, there is always some risk in sending data to hardware when we don't understand exactly how that hardware works.  There have been issues in the past with certain hardware getting damaged/bricked and we have either disabled or fixed the offending code.  That said, with OpenRGB always changing and the landscape of RGB devices being of widely varying quality, we can't guarantee it won't happen again.  By installing and using OpenRGB you accept this risk.

## Support OpenRGB

* OpenRGB is a project I created to solve a problem I had with the RGB ecosystem.  My goal isn't to make money off of this project.  That said, people have requested to donate, and donations allow me to buy more RGB stuff to reverse engineer.
* [Donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=4VPTFMD3G4QVG&item_name=OpenRGB+Development&currency_code=USD&source=url)

## History of OpenRGB

* OpenRGB is a continuation of OpenAuraSDK, which itself was created out of reverse engineering work done on the Keyboard Visualizer project.  For a complete history of the RGB projects that led to OpenRGB's creation, see the [History page](https://gitlab.com/OpenRGBDevelopers/OpenRGB-Wiki/-/blob/stable/History-of-OpenRGB.md).

## Contributing

* Want to contribute support for a new device?  Check out the [RGBController API](Documentation/RGBControllerAPI.md) page for documentation of how OpenRGB implements device control.
* Want to create a new OpenRGB SDK client implementation?  Check out the [OpenRGB SDK Documentation](Documentation/OpenRGBSDK.md) page for documentation of how the OpenRGB SDK network protocol functions.
* Please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting work on your new changes.

## OpenRGB SDK

* OpenRGB provides a network interface for controlling supported RGB devices from other software.  These projects implement the OpenRGB SDK and provide additional ways for you to control your lighting setup.
